tdver - test-driven versioning
=====

## Introduction
The backstory might belong on a blog, but I'm not blogging at the moment.
I'm doing early work on a Python BDD module, and pondering my initial
versioning. When both of these ideas shared the same headspace, I had a
fever-dream of a world in which software versioning is test-driven--a place
where machine-applied rules allow our ever-incrementing version numbers to carry
semantic freight they ironically can't often carry when individual developers
make decisions about when to increment.

## Goal
The purpose of this repository is to pretend the fever-dream was real, and
test its _plausibility_ by developing a specification for test-driven
versioning. If the specification can ever navigate the obvious obstacles and be
resolved into stable/sane logic for man and machine, the next steps are to build
tools implementing it, and see if a real-world project can survive test-driven
versioning.

This is a [call for dreamers][a]. Pull requests and issues appreciated.

## Specification
I'm going to resist the urge to include my own thoughts to avoid
starting the discussion in too-small a box.
